  In the reading, Salter mentioned Schwitters's Merzbuhne which was quite an interesting take on creating a piece of work.
He would use many different types of physical contemporary tools, things like paper, cardboard, etc. 
However, Schwitters was trying to create something that was similar to that of a performance and went beyond by using items that are liquid and gas which would be his "actors".
Whatever he saw that had a physical property, he was able to have a vision of using said item in his works.
Although, the way Schwitters's art and vision was different from Wagner's, he was able to utilize many objects in his work.

  When it comes to digital tools, many artists utilized mailing programs to creating their own websites and made collages of things from news articles, posts from other users, or even creating a sort of interactive story.
People also made databases to collect information on things like censored cases or post missives regarding a rebellion among other things.
Some of the works from Rhizome's Anthology of Net Art consists of works created by one person but has expanded with the help of many others online.
When it comes to a work that is Gesamtkunstwerk, I believe that the work from Olia Lialina, "My Boyfriend Came Back From The War" is one of the closest piece to being considered one.
I say this because it combines many different elements like a story, imagery, as well as an interactive story.
When all of these combine together into one, it brings forth a cohesive piece of work.
