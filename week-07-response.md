  While reading James Bridle's "Something is Wrong on the Internet", I can defintely see why James wants Youtube and Google to be held accountable with the content being put up on youtube.
The points he makes are all related to children because, whether or not they're being targeted, they are the ones being affected the most.
I can relate to it since as a kid I've always watched Youtube and mostly had a good time out of it.
However, there would be times where I would stumble upon something that frightens me or like James said in his essay, "traumatise" me but I didn't think much of it.
I do agree with all the points he's making though, Youtube nowadays is way different than it was before and the videos being posted on there are all pretty much saturated and pirated content from trends that seem to be popular.

   The solution being pointed out was something that fixes one issue but it doesn't fix everything.
 There are always going to be other platforms that could and will try to do the same thing that Youtube has done in order to generate views and money.
 It is hard to imagine that Youtube would shut down their service since they have been trying remedy the problem by updating policies where youtubers nowadays have a specific guideline to follow if they want to publish something and make money of off ad revenue.
 While James does have a good vision of what the internet should be, I just don't think it will be possible with today's world already being as it is.
