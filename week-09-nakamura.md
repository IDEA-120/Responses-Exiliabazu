  When thinking about Nakamura's citation of Lev Manovich saying "interactive media ask us to identify with someone else's mental structure", I think it meant how a developer would want its audience or the people interacting to see their product from their perspective.
  For example when you're playing a video game, the creators purposefully used a fictional character and made them into someone who you control and therefore you're identifying with that specific character's mental structure.
  Their abilities isn't something a normal person may have but the video game allows the normal person to experience what it's like to have powers. 
  A big example of this is Insomniac's Spider-man game where you get to play as the popular Spider-man and swing around New York.
  
  I tend to use TikTok a lot on the go or just when I am bored half the time.
  I believe that the developers of the app made it specifically for people who enjoy short videos and for those who might not have a lot of time to consume media.
  It was also made so that people could create and share their videos with others to build a community while expressing themselves whether it be a made up persona or just being themselves.
  Maybe the creator was someone who was always on the go and rarely has time to watch any media and so created this app so that they could consume a lot of media within minutes and thought it would be a good idea.
  Many people nowadays use this app wherever they are and many of who gets lost swiping up looking for new videos and content perhaps just like the developer who made it.
