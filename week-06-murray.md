  I believe that Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments were successful. It's honestly kind of scary how accurate Murray predicted how internet television is going to be because most of the things outlined are spot on. Things like being able to predict how popular internet television is to predicting how movies, shows, etc. would be in the future which includes things like interactive shows. Another thing that Murray touches on is how the VR world would change where the player could interact with environments and experience them. When comparing Murray's prediction on hyper-realistic virtual environment to 'The Mandalorian' inhabit while acting, I think that it is kind of similar but instead of utilizing VR technology they opted to envelop the actors and all camerawork inside an LED sort of bubble. In there the actors can clearly see their environment and can get more into character since they would only have to imagine how the character would act inside that world. The actor gets to live in the reality of the environment while viewers get to experience the reality of that world via watching the show.
